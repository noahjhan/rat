process to introduce new tokens 

if token already exists... 

    add new representation as string in set in lexer construtor

    check isAcceptable function for either:
        1. conflicts with current implementation -> ambiguous tokens
        2. uninclusive implementation -> unrecognized tokrn

    add ConsituentToken and translation in token.hpp and dictionary.hpp

if token is new...

    add new set in lexer construtor and lexer class 

    add new token as GenericToken in token.hpp

    create new isAcceptable function

    modify advanceToken function to avoid ambiguous tokens 
        that is, a new token cannot be interpreted in more than one way

    add ConsituentToken and translation in token.hpp and dictionary.hpp

    add error_checker in parser.hpp
