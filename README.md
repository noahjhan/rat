# Rat Programming Language

## Introduction

"In many ways, the work of a programmer is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their code and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on ambiguous commit messages, which are fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we programmers must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk code is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a programmer truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends.

Last night, I experienced something new, an extra-ordinary language from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the language and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine coding is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Alan Turing's famous quote: â€˜Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do the things no one can imagine.â€™ But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great computer scientist, but a great computer scientist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at RatLang, who is, in this programmer's opinion, nothing less than the finest coder on Github. I will be returning to noahjhan/rat soon, hungry for more."

Rat is a bare bones, general purpose, statically-typed, purely functional, 'rataturing-complete', personal-project programming language inspired by the Pixar film, Ratatouille. It combines features of Haskell, C, OCaml, and Rust. But is currently a glorified lexer. Honestly, it is a gloried main.cpp file. #UNIT_TESTING! 

## Informal Grammar

### Basic Syntax

**Hello World**: A simple rat program

    fn_ main() {
        println("Hello, World")
        rev                         // return void
    }

**Keywords**: 

fn specifies a pure function - first class function with static return type

fn_ specifies a void function - no return (this is useful for syscalls) 

fn? specifies an optional function - can return NULL, output will be cast to optional type

fn/ specifies an anonymous or lambda function

**Loops**: Recursion

Rat is a functional programming language, which means no conventional for-loops. 

    fn_ printer(start: uint, end: uint) {
        if (start >= end) {                 // base case
            rev
        }

        print(start)
        printer(start + 1, end)             // recursive step 
        rev
    }


    fn_ main() {
        printer(0, 9)
        rev
    }
    
    // expected output: "0123456789"

**Conditional Statments**

    let x: int = 10

    if (x > 10) {
        print("x is greater than 10")
    } else if (x < 10) {
        print("x is less than 10")
    } else {
        print("x is equal to 10")
    }

    // expected output: "x is equal to 10"
